            I’m a passionate full-stack software engineer with a unique blend of technical expertise, client relations, and strategic leadership. My journey into software development began with an intensive six-month bootcamp at App Academy, where I gained hands-on experience in JavaScript, Python, React, Redux Toolkit, Flask, and SQL, building modern, user-focused web applications.            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
            Beyond writing code, I specialize in bridging technology with business needs. Whether it’s developing scalable applications, designing efficient APIs, or optimizing user experiences, I thrive on creating innovative solutions that drive value for both users and stakeholders. My ability to communicate complex technical concepts in a clear and strategic manner enables me to collaborate effectively across teams—from engineers to executives to customers.

            <p className="mb-4">
            Prior to transitioning into tech, I spent years in program management and client-facing roles, leading high-performance teams and driving revenue growth. As a Program Manager at EXOS, I spearheaded initiatives that expanded client engagement by 30%, hired and managed a team of 50+ employees, and delivered key business objectives in a fast-paced, high-stakes environment. My experience as a real estate professional further strengthened my ability to navigate complex negotiations, analyze market trends, and provide data-driven solutions—skills that now enhance my approach to solving technical and business challenges.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
            I’m driven by curiosity, adaptability, and a passion for problem-solving. Whether working with customers, engineering teams, or leadership, I bring a solution-oriented mindset that ensures the successful implementation of technology that aligns with business goals.

            When I’m not building software, you’ll find me exploring the outdoors, spending time with family, or brainstorming the next big project.
